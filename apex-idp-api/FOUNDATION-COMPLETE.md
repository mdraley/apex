The complete API foundation is now implemented and ready for actual development work. This includes:

1. **All Bounded Contexts**: Seven fully configured modules ready for business logic implementation
2. **Security Infrastructure**: Complete JWT-based authentication and authorization
3. **Event Sourcing**: Full audit trail and event-driven capabilities
4. **CQRS Pattern**: Scalable command and query separation
5. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket-based notifications for all contexts
6. **Testing Framework**: Complete integration testing infrastructure
7. **Documentation**: OpenAPI 3.0 specification ready for API development

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Workflow

### Starting Development
1. **Choose a Bounded Context**: Select any of the 7 modules to begin implementation
2. **Implement Domain Models**: Create entities, value objects, and aggregates
3. **Add Business Logic**: Implement domain services and business rules
4. **Create APIs**: Add REST controllers with OpenAPI documentation
5. **Write Tests**: Use the provided testing infrastructure
6. **Integrate Events**: Leverage the event sourcing and CQRS infrastructure
