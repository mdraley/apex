# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Overview

### Product Name

**Apex Rural Invoice Intelligence Platform (Apex IIP)**

### Purpose

The Apex IIP is designed to automate the ingestion, understanding and processing of invoices for rural hospitals and similar mid‑sized healthcare providers.  It leverages the core Apex Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) platform to eliminate manual data entry, accelerate payment cycles and generate strategic insights from vendor transactions.  The system integrates zero‑configuration AI models, knowledge graphs, and human‑in‑the‑loop validation to deliver highly accurate, compliant and scalable document processing

### Background/Context

Rural hospitals often operate with limited administrative resources yet manage thousands of invoices per year.  Manual processing is time consuming, error‑prone and delays payment to suppliers.  The Apex mission is to democratize intelligent document processing by creating a self‑optimizing platform that transforms unstructured documents into actionable data

.  Earlier proof‑of‑concepts showed value in digitizing documents but lacked scalability and clear service boundaries.  The enhanced Apex IIP introduces bounded contexts, event‑driven processing and knowledge‑graph‑powered search to move from prototype to enterprise‑grade SaaS

- **AC‑06:** Chat responses shall include the correct answer, associated confidence score and citations to supporting documents.
- **AC‑07:** All user actions shall be logged with timestamps and user IDs for audit purposes.

## Design/User Experience

The Apex IIP user experience consists of three primary interfaces:

1. **Batch Creation Page:** Users create a batch by entering basic metadata (name, type, default document type, description, priority) and uploading files via drag‑and‑drop or browsing. Users can select preprocessing options such as auto‑orientation, auto‑rotation and graphics cleanup. A “Submit” button triggers processing. If files are invalid, clear error messages are displayed.
2. **Batch List & Selection:** A table shows existing batches with columns such as Batch Name, Type, Priority, Document count, Pages, Creator and Timestamps. Users can filter or search and select a batch to load for review.
3. **Validation UI:** The central work area displays document thumbnails in a panel, extraction fields with confidence indicators, and a preview of the invoice with highlighted fields. Editable form fields allow corrections, while a line‑item grid supports adding, editing or removing rows. Buttons enable saving or returning the batch. For completed batches, check marks indicate fully reviewed documents.
4. **Chat & Search Panel (future release):** Users can chat with the system or perform semantic searches across all processed invoices. Responses include confidence scores and citations.

The UI adheres to a clean, minimalist design, using color cues (e.g., red for low confidence, green for validated fields) and progressive disclosure to minimize cognitive load.

## Assumptions, Constraints, and Dependencies

### Assumptions

- Hospitals have stable internet connectivity to upload documents and use a cloud‑hosted platform.
- Invoices are primarily in English; multilingual support may be added later.
- Users will provide feedback on low‑confidence fields to improve models.
- Existing ERPs/EHRs provide APIs or file import mechanisms for integration.

### Constraints

- Limited training data for handwritten invoices may reduce accuracy; handwritten extraction is out of scope for phase 1.
- Regulatory constraints (HIPAA, GDPR) require strict data handling and storage practices.
- Budget and resource limits may restrict the number of AI models that can be trained concurrently.

### Dependencies

- Underlying AI models (Tesseract, LayoutLMv3, DocTR) and ML frameworks (PyTorch, Hugging Face) for extraction.
- Infrastructure platforms: Kubernetes, AWS/Azure serverless services (e.g., Textract for OCR), Kafka, Redis, PostgreSQL and Neo4j.
- Third‑party connectors for ERP/EHR systems (e.g., Epic, SAP, Cerner, Salesforce) and compliance frameworks.
- Availability of subject‑matter experts for validation and model retraining.

- **Monitoring & Observability:** Prometheus, Grafana and Jaeger for metrics, dashboards and distributed tracing.

## Open Questions and Future Considerations

1. **Document Diversity:** What other document types (e.g., purchase orders, receipts) should be prioritized after invoices?
2. **Handwritten Fields:** To what extent do rural hospitals receive handwritten invoices? Do we need specialized handwriting recognition models?
3. **Model Customization:** Will customers require the ability to fine‑tune models on their own data? How should this be exposed?
4. **On‑Premise Deployment:** Some hospitals may require full on‑premise deployment. What are the hardware constraints and licensing implications?
5. **Vendor Portal:** Should suppliers be given access to a portal to submit invoices directly and review status?
6. **Mobile App:** Is there a need for a dedicated mobile scanning app beyond mobile‑web upload?
