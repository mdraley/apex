# UI Flow Diagrams

This directory contains Mermaid diagrams and other visual representations of the user interface flows for the Apex IDP platform.

## Diagram Types

### 1. Flow Charts
- **authentication-flow.md**: User login and role-based routing
- **document-upload-flow.md**: Document submission and processing workflow
- **validation-workflow.md**: Human validation and approval processes
- **vendor-portal-flow.md**: Vendor self-service portal interactions
- **executive-dashboard-flow.md**: CFO dashboard and analytics flows

### 2. Sequence Diagrams
- **api-integration-sequence.md**: API call sequences for ERP integration
- **real-time-notifications.md**: WebSocket notification flows
- **batch-processing-sequence.md**: Document batch processing workflow

### 3. System Architecture Diagrams
- **component-architecture.md**: High-level component relationships
- **data-flow-diagram.md**: Data movement through the system
- **security-architecture.md**: Security boundaries and access controls

## Editing Guidelines

### Mermaid Syntax
All diagrams use Mermaid syntax for consistency and maintainability. When editing:

1. Use consistent node naming conventions
2. Include descriptive labels for clarity
3. Add comments for complex decision points
4. Test diagrams in Mermaid Live Editor before committing

### Color Coding Standards
- **Blue**: User actions and inputs
- **Green**: Successful processes and approvals
- **Yellow**: Warning states and pending actions
- **Red**: Error states and rejections
- **Purple**: System processes and automation

### Accessibility Requirements
- All diagrams must include alt-text descriptions
- Color combinations must meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast requirements
- Text size must be readable at minimum 16px equivalent
- Complex diagrams should include text-based alternatives

## File Naming Convention

```
[flow-type]-[user-role]-[specific-action].md

Examples:
- authentication-all-users-login.md
- document-clerk-validation-process.md
- dashboard-cfo-cash-flow-analysis.md
```

## Integration with Documentation

These diagrams are referenced throughout the main UI flow documentation and should be kept in sync with:
- ../README.md (main UI flow documentation)
- ../../tdd/ (Technical Design Document)
- ../../architecture-*.md (Architecture documentation)

## Tools and Resources

### Recommended Editors
- Mermaid Live Editor: https://mermaid.live/
- VS Code Mermaid Preview Extension
- Draw.io (for complex architectural diagrams)

### Diagram Templates
See the `templates/` subdirectory for standard diagram templates that maintain consistency across the documentation.
