I'll create a comprehensive TODO document that captures the entire chat history, including the system alignment analysis and all the fixes that were made. Let me fetch the current state of the docs folder first to understand the structure.

```bash
ls -la docs/
```

Now I'll create a comprehensive TODO document that captures everything from our chat history:

## Key Takeaways from the Analysis

The system has been stabilized from build errors, but requires significant architectural transformation:

1. **Immediate Success**: All 200+ compilation errors have been resolved
2. **Major Gap**: System is monolithic instead of microservices as specified in TDD
3. **Critical Missing Components**: ML pipeline, knowledge graph, proper event sourcing
4. **Estimated Effort**: 6-12 months with 8-10 developers for full TDD compliance

The TODO documents are now saved in the docs folder and can be used to track progress toward full TDD alignment. The team should prioritize the ML processing service and knowledge graph as these are the core differentiators for the APEX IDP platform.
